        <p>Voyager is a user generated exploration tool that allows users to find and explore new and fun points of interests in a city. Whether someone is visiting from out of town or a local who just wants to find something to do, Voyager gives every users a chance to explore.</p>

          <p>During the Code Fellows UX Engineering Bootcamp, we were instructed to form teams of three to build a clickable web application prototype in four days.  After brainstorming different ideas, we decided on Voyager.  As a result of the time constraint, my team decided to build out three core pages: the home page, a city listings page, and an expedition details page.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Here is our process:</h4>
          <br>
          <h4>Workflow</h4>
          <p>Using tools like Trello and Graphviz, we were able to stay on task and have a constant line of communication.  Graphviz allowed us to visually see our application's workflow and pinpoint the key areas of development.  Trello allowed us to stay updated with the team's progress in a clean and fluid environment.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>Utilizing a mobile-first stategy, I began sketching out our wireframes.</p>
          <br>

            <figcaption>City Listing Page</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h4>Style Guide</h4>
          <p>We designed a style guide to add consistency to our project.  Thinking of the user, we went with a modern easy-to-read font, Open Sans, and picked nature/outdoors colors to go with Voyager's Exploration aesthetic.<p>

          </figure>
          <h4>Design with Code</h4>
          <p>To start builing our project, we employed pair programming to build out a semantic HTML structure using Skeleton Grid.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="css/images/voyager-code.jpg">
          </figure>
          <p>After the core HTML structure was in place, we began to incorporate design elements in CSS, incorporating elements from the style guide throughout. jQuery was then used to add interactivity to our prototype. The finished results can be seen below.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section>
      <p>Hello! My name is Macy and I'm a <a href="">Code Fellows Bootcamp</a> Graduate and self-taught UX Designer & Front-End Developer based in Seattle, WA.  I believe that design is a process that should always involve all team members: developers included.</p><br>
      <p>Outside of honing my skills as a designer and developer, I like to enjoy the crisp Northwest air camping or hiking with my partner and our dog.  I am a thrill seeker and an adrenaline junkie.  If it's exciting and adventurous - I will probably be there.  In turn, my favorite sports I play are rugby and boxing.  I also love playing video games (Zelda, FF Series, etc) and board games (Dominion anyone?).  In the end, I am a weird mix of sports junkie meets total geeky nerdiness.</p>
